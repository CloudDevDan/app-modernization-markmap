# 🗺️ Dan’s Microsoft App Modernization Framework Markmap

Welcome to **Dan’s Microsoft App Modernization Framework Markmap** – a structured, visual reference built on top of Microsoft's official [App Modernization Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-modernization-guidance/) within the [Azure Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/).

This project helps you visualise how to assess, plan, modernise, and optimise legacy applications using Microsoft technologies – especially within Azure. Whether you're dealing with monolithic on-prem systems or scaling modern cloud-native architectures, this map provides a clear, end-to-end structure for transforming your applications with confidence.

This resource is built using [**Markmap**](https://markmap.js.org/), a JavaScript-powered tool that turns Markdown lists into **interactive mind maps**. The result is a dynamic, explorable way to understand and organize terminology across a broad AI landscape - from foundational learning paradigms to Microsoft-specific AI services.

## 🔍 What Is Microsoft App Modernization (CAF)?

The **Microsoft App Modernization** framework is an adoption scenario within the Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) that helps organisations modernise their applications for the cloud using a structured, phased approach.

This guidance is organised into seven key stages:

- 🏁 **Get Started** – Understand the modernization lifecycle, maturity model, and roadmap.
- 🔍 **Assess** – Evaluate your existing applications, infrastructure, and readiness for cloud.
- 🧭 **Plan** – Select the right modernization strategy using the 6 Rs and plan your transformation.
- 🚀 **Launch** – Build a proof of concept and establish a secure foundation.
- 🧱 **Foundation** – Lay technical foundations across platforms such as .NET, Java, SAP, Oracle, and VMware.
- 📈 **Expand** – Adopt microservices, serverless, APIs, and data modernisation practices.
- 💡 **Innovate & ⚙️ Optimize** – Enable AI, low-code tools, performance scaling, and DevOps to drive long-term value.

Each phase provides enterprise-grade guidance, tools, and architecture patterns to support application transformation on Azure.

You can explore the full guidance and all checklist items visually through this interactive Markmap.

### 🔎 App Modernization vs CAF vs WAF – How They Fit Together

Yes – the **App Modernization Framework** is part of Microsoft's broader **Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)**. Here's how it all fits:

- 🧭 **CAF (Cloud Adoption Framework)** is Microsoft's main playbook for adopting Azure. It covers everything from strategy and planning to governance, security, and operations. One of its key stages is **Modernize**, where app modernization lives.
  
- 🏗️ The **App Modernization Framework** is the **detailed guidance that supports that Modernize phase**. It provides the step-by-step advice, tools, best practices, and platform options to modernise legacy applications – from .NET to SAP – using Azure services.

- 🧱 **WAF (Well-Architected Framework)** is different – it’s all about **technical quality**. It helps you design and run workloads that are secure, reliable, cost-optimised, performant, and operationally excellent. You can apply WAF principles **during and after modernization**.

#### 📚 Microsoft Evidence

- The official [CAF Overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/overview) includes **Modernize** as a core phase.
- The [App Modernization Guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-modernization-guidance/) links directly from the **CAF hub** and shares structure with other CAF-aligned content.
- The [CAF Methodology](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/migrate/modernize) explains how application modernization supports business goals and cloud-native maturity.

So, in short:

- **CAF** = the master cloud journey
- **App Mod Framework** = the guide for modernizing your apps (part of CAF)
- **WAF** = quality checks to make sure your solutions are well-architected

If you're looking to better understand why the Azure Cloud Adoption Framework matters and how it fits into the broader cloud transformation journey, check out this article from the Azure Architecture team:

👉 [Why you need a Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)... and probably a WAF too](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azurearchitectureblog/why-you-need-a-cloud-adoption-framework-caf-and-probably-a-waf-too/3667426)
> Published on Microsoft Tech Community

This piece provides insight into how CAF supports structure and accountability in cloud journeys - and why governance (and sometimes a "WAF") shouldn't be an afterthought. -->

## 🎯 About This Project

I've built this project because I'm a visual learner, and while the Microsoft documentation for the Azure Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) is excellent and comprehensive, the sheer volume of information can be overwhelming. Visualising the framework in an interactive map helps me better understand the structure, flow, and relationships between its components.

By making this project open, I hope others can benefit from this format too - whether you're just beginning your cloud journey or looking for a clearer way to communicate CAF principles to your team.

- Navigate through the hierarchy
- Expand/collapse terms as needed

---

## 🤝 Community Contributions

## 🛠 How It's Built

This project uses [Markmap](https://markmap.js.org) to convert a Markdown list into an interactive mind map.  
After exporting the map, a custom **post-processing script** applies visual enhancements including:

- Dark mode theme
- Custom font and header
- White text and dark background for readability
- A favicon
- Branding and blog link

---

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

Install the Markmap CLI (if not already installed):

```bash
npm install -g markmap-cli
```

Then run this command from the root of the repo:

```bash
npx markmap-cli markmap.md -o ./docs/index.html --no-open && node postprocess-map.js
```

This generates the visual map and applies styling in one go.

## 🔗 Link Checker

This project includes a `check-links.js` script that scans all external links in `markmap.md` to:

- Identify broken or redirected URLs
- Report any issues in a dedicated `broken-links.log` file
- Help maintain high-quality, up-to-date reference links for learners

### ✅ Why this exists:
Because this tracker is intended to be long-lived and reliable, it's important to regularly check that:
- All links point to official and active sources (e.g., Microsoft Learn, Wikipedia, GitHub)
- There are no outdated, redirected, or dead references in the mind map

### ▶️ How to run it:

```bash
node check-links.js
```

This will:
- Output results to the terminal (with ✅ and ❌ indicators)
- Write any issues to `broken-links.log` for review
- Automatically clear the log if no issues are found

## 🌐 Why the `/docs` Folder?

The `docs` folder is used because GitHub Pages has been configured to serve static content from it.  
The `index.html` is published at:
